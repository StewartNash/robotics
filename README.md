The manual is given in LaTeX format and must be compiled. (A compiled PDF may be included in the future.)
## Dynamics
Select kinematic and dynamic topics are covered.
### Kinematics
### Differential Motions
### Dynamics Analysis
### Trajectory Planning
## Controls
Select topics in controls are covered.
### State Variable Representation
State variable representations of systems described by both linear differential equations and linear difference equations are covered.
### Signal Flow Graphs
### Nyquist Analysis and Design
### Root Locus Analysis and Design
### Bode Analysis and Design
## Image Processing
Select topics in image processing and computer vision are covered.
